		<p>
		<!-- Replace the default link URL with the one for your chosen site -->
		The purpose of the website it to serve as a portfolio. Hopefully if everything goes as planned, it will consist of multiple categories of my personal projects and work. Because I create work with multiple methods, including digital illustration, traditional drawing, sculpture, comics, and animation, I want to utilize this site to be able to showcase the variety in an organizatonal yet aesthetic manner.  </p>

	<h2 id="audience"> Who is the intended audience?</h2>
	    <p>
	    <!-- Replace the default link URL with the one for your chosen site -->
	    The intended audience is whoever is interested in seeing my work and what I am capable of. Since it is portfolio, it's ideal to have my technical abilities demonstrated through the work that could be found through surfing the site. That means peers, colleagues, potential employers, and even simply friends who are curious to see what I have worked on/what I'm working are part of my intended viewers.

        <h2 id="tone">What tone do you want for the siteâ€™s written content?</h2>
        <p>Because the intended audience is an intermixture of peers and potential employers, I want to have a formal tone when it comes to the layout of the site. Organized form portrays a sense of professionalism, so I hope to have my work easily accessible in different categories. However, when it comes to context, which probably only the "About" section will have, I'm going for more of an informal tone, in hopes of a more welcoming and amicable setting, as to a stern, rigid resume-type structure.   </p>

        <h2 id="primary">What will be the primary content of your site?</h2>
        <p>As a porfolio, the primary content the site will consist of will be mostly my work. The audience will be able to look through the content by clicking on different pages on the navigation bar. Such clickable links will be: the about me page, digital work, traditional work, animation work, graphic design, and webcomic. Each link will lead the user to a new landing page, of my work associated to each category. Below shows a small collection the work I intent to have as my primary content under the "digital work" link.</p>

    <section>
    <h2 id="secondary">What will be the secondary content?</h2>
        <p>The secondary content will be information that as to do with "about me", contact, social media, and potentially a page with an external link that leads to print store. Ultimately, the secondary information will compare to a mini-resume, with an introduction as well as information on previous work or current projects. Ways to contact me via email or Instagram will be available as well. </p>
    </section>
    <section>
    <h2 id="navigation">How will users navigate through your site? </h2>
        <p>As mentioned before, there will be multiple categories available to browse through on the head navigation. The options in the pink bar are the main links that generalize the content that will be listed under it. So for example, based on the diagram below, an user can click on "Digital Art", and will be able to click through any of the subcategories listed. If the user clicks on "Fanart", he or she will be lead to another landing page, of content that consists of fanart I have painted digitally. </p>
